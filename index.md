# [](#header-1)About me

I am an active member of the Slovak Python community since 2015.
As SPy o.z. Vice-Chairman, I have co-organized PyCon SK 2016 and PyCon SK 2017.

I believe Python and MicroPython should be taught at Slovak High Schools, and so I started organizing workshops for teachers as well as giving presentations (EduTrack 2017).
